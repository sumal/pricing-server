pricing-server
==============

It is a pricing system in php

I have done this project in plane PHP
I have created a database named test in my local with a table named interest.
There are 3 fields in the table.They are id,day,and rate which describes interest rates in different day limits
I didnt given much significance to html design since the core functionality is important than design
